            <h3>Mudgee branch of Amnesty International welcomes decision on Syrian refugees</h3>
            <p>The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. Ms Drew said Amnesty was pleased the Australian government has decided to take in some of the millions of Syrian’s unable to return home, especially considering how desperate the situation is getting. 

“It’s a start really,” Ms Drew said.

“The number of Syrian people who are no longer able to return to their own country is in its millions, and all of these people are desperate to make a new home for themselves. 

“We’ve agreed to take 12,000 but the government may need to think about agreeing to take more.”

Ms Drew said while some people had made suggestions that the number was too high, Germany had agreed to house 800,000 refugees that made their way to Europe.

“Twelve thousand people sounds wonderful in comparison to the number Australia agreed to take a year ago, but compared to the total number of people who need help – maybe the government will need to look at the figures again,” Ms Drew said.

Ms Drew said there are around four million Syrian refugees registered with humanitarian groups. 

A large percentage of these people are immigrated to neighbouring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, putting strain on the local economies and resources. 

“There are 7.6 million people who are internally displaced in Syria. People are saying this is the largest humanitarian disaster since the last world war,” Ms Drew said. 

Ms Drew said it was fantastic to see the public becoming involved in the issue, and believed it was a continuing level of public support that pushed the government to agree to help. 

“There’s word that quite a few towns around the country are willing to take rather large numbers of refugees and help them create new lives,” she said. 

“And a lot more people than the government has agreed to take in.”

According to the federal government, women, children, and families from persecuted minorities sheltering in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey will take priority. 

The government will also spend $44 million supplying 240,000 refugees with cash, food, water and blankets in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.

Senior government officials said the first refugees could arrive by Christmas. 

It’s intended that the 12,000 will arrive within the financial year.</p>

            <h3>Jordan Spieth: Golfer sets prize money record</h3>
            <p>American regains No. 1 ranking with Tour Championship win   (CNN) -  
Record-breaker and history-maker Jordan Spieth has reaped the rewards of becoming golf's new superstar this year -- and now the American is planning to share his riches. 

His spectacular season culminated in landing an $11.5 million jackpot on Sunday, when he regained the world No. 1 ranking by winning the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup finale. 

Spieth's four-stroke victory at the Tour Championship clinched the $10 million prize for winning the four-tournament series, and took his total earnings for 2015 past $22 million. It surpassed the record of $20.9 million set by Tiger Woods in 2007. 
 
"For me it's important to give it back to not only the people that need it, but also to our team who made it possible," the 22-year-old told CNN. 

"This is a bonus that isn't just for me, I promise you that. 

"This is going to a lot of various places because this season was magical and there was a lot of behind the scenes work done by a lot of people, and I want to be able to share that with them." 

With Australian Jason Day failing to finish in the top five on Sunday, Spieth took the PGA Championship winner's place at the top of the rankings. 

The Texan was able to celebrate his incredible weekend of success with his whole family and says it was made all the more special by the presence of his autistic sister Ellie, who missed out on his previous wins. 

"It was really cool, it was great. When she came out I didn't even see her," he said. 

"I wasn't expecting it, she just kind of ran into me and gave me a hug. It was awesome. 

"It was special to have everybody here, it was just like the Masters except that Ellie was added in too. 

"I owe everything to my family. They're my inspiration, they're the ones who put in the sacrifice to allow me to be here so I'm able to now celebrate with them and it's going to be fun." 

Spieth's season started with victories in the opening two majors -- the U.S. Open and the Masters -- and he fell just short of becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the opening three when he missed out on a playoff at the British Open by one shot. 

He then tied for second at the PGA Championship, but missed the cut in the opening two FedEx Cup playoff events before bouncing back when it most mattered at East Lake. 

The Atlanta venue was the home course of golf legend Bobby Jones, the only man to win a calendar grand slam -- in 1930, when two of the majors were amateur championships. 

"It's amazing. It's almost like a major championship," Spieth said of the elite 30-player event. 

"What an unbelievable venue this is, the scene of a lot of Bobby Jones' history. 

"It's cool to come back here and attack this golf course and play it the right way. I didn't make it easy on myself but all in all that last walk up 18 was pretty fun."</p>

            <h3>Diego Maradona Blasts Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini</h3>
            <p>15 de septiembre de 2015,   15:52 Rome, 15 Sep (Prensa Latina) Argentinian super star Diego Maradona has trashed the idea of UEFA President Michel Platini succeeding Sepp Blatter as new FIFA president. 
 Argentinian football legend Maradona suggests Platini is every bit as corrupt as the disgraced, outgoing Blatter.  He has also suggested he'll stand by the side of another candidate come election time. 
During an appearance on Naples television station PiuEnne  Maradona made it clear he considers voting for Platini as merely a vote to continue the same culture of corruption that has recently defined football's governing body: "Blatter did a lot of harm to football and with Platini, it's a farce. They pretend to be separated, one at FIFA and the other at UEFA, while in fact they were always side by side." 

Maradona didn't stop there. He stressed that Platini is no different than Blatter and that the Frenchman is the wrong man to introduce much needed change at the top of the sport: "If we want a transparent FIFA, we cannot vote for Platini who has been close to Blatter, who taught him how to steal." 

The controversial former World Cup winner revealed he will back Prince Ali of Jordan for the presidency.    Maradona even intends to work alongside Ali should the Prince win: "If he should win the election, I will be at his side as vice-president."

            <h3>Watkins the star in Wormelow awards evening</h3>
            <p>WORMELOW’S 50th anniversary dinner turned into a big celebration for one of the club’s young all-rounders.

            <h3>New Season, New Shows, Still Guessing About TV Networks</h3>
            <p>Pressing questions are always asked about my prime-time viewing: 
My wife: “What network is ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ on?” I didn’t answer. Instead, I asked: “What
broadcast network did ‘The Mindy Project” air on?” She said: “NBC!”   

It’s a confusing media world for sure. 

“Mindy” was on Fox; now
at Hulu; “Nine-Nine” is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what
network it’s on? Branding, schmanding! 

On the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food
and Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. 

Over the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the
sports network-- but on CNBC, NBC’s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I’m “cycling” in and out of stock investments in my
portfolio. 

Seeing content in places you don’t expect? Not a trend. 

Still, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover.
Turner airs plenty of NCAA Men’s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV “Video Music Awards” this year on many more of its cable networks. 

Much of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. 

So with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV
viewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like “Supergirl” and “The Muppets”? (“Supergirl” will be on CBS; “The Muppets,” ABC”). 

Yes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. 

Yet in the future, established TV network brands might want
to be a lot of more than they are.</p>

            <h3>Breen has funding cut from Athletics Australia</h3>
            <p>Canberra sprinter Melissa Breen has paid the price for a poor world championships by having her funding cut from Athletics Australia. 

Australia's fastest woman in history over 100 metres, the 25-year-old was left off the National Athlete Support Structure membership program on Monday. 

Breen was a late addition to the program last year after she broke Melinda Gainsford-Taylor's 20-year-old national record in the women's 100m with a time of 11.11 seconds. 

But Breen has struggled to carry that form to the world stage and has missed out on the semi-finals four times in a row. 

The final straw was when she finished second-last in her heat at this year's world championships with a disappointing time of 11.61 seconds. 

Athletics Australia high performance director Simon Nathan said it was the selection committee's decision that Breen was unlikely to achieve the program's goals of reaching the top eight at a world championships or Olympic Games. 

"She's done everything she can do and been professional and done all the right things, but the outcomes and the actual results at the championships are such that we can't see her making that top eight in the future," Nathan said. 

"That's why we took her off the program and it lets us support someone else. 

"There isn't anybody who tries harder on the team or is more dedicated to training, but what she is unable to do is get that out at the big championships. 

"It's a competitive group and she's struggling to get out of the first round." 

Breen will still receive partial funding after being included in the Gold Coast GOLD Relay Program designed to support relay squads ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. She also has a scholarship with ACTAS. 

Breen's training partner Lauren Wells, middle-distance runner Zoe Buckman and javelin thrower Kelsey-Lee Roberts have been included in the Podium Potential category. 

It is the second-tier of funding that includes 42 of the 72 athletes who are in the NASS program. 

Breen has admitted she made a mistake in training in Canberra ahead of the world championships instead of competing overseas. 

Nathan said her preparation didn't factor into the funding decision. 

"She tried something different and whether she would do it again, I don't know," Nathan said. "Unless you try, you don't know. 

"It's the championship results and the outcomes in that environment that we are making our assessments on."</p>
