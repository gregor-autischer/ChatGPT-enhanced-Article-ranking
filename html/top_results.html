            <h3>Mudgee branch of Amnesty International welcomes decision on Syrian refugees</h3>
            <p>The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. Ms Drew said Amnesty was pleased the Australian government has decided to take in some of the millions of Syrian’s unable to return home, especially considering how desperate the situation is getting. 

“It’s a start really,” Ms Drew said.

“The number of Syrian people who are no longer able to return to their own country is in its millions, and all of these people are desperate to make a new home for themselves. 

“We’ve agreed to take 12,000 but the government may need to think about agreeing to take more.”

Ms Drew said while some people had made suggestions that the number was too high, Germany had agreed to house 800,000 refugees that made their way to Europe.

“Twelve thousand people sounds wonderful in comparison to the number Australia agreed to take a year ago, but compared to the total number of people who need help – maybe the government will need to look at the figures again,” Ms Drew said.

Ms Drew said there are around four million Syrian refugees registered with humanitarian groups. 

A large percentage of these people are immigrated to neighbouring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, putting strain on the local economies and resources. 

“There are 7.6 million people who are internally displaced in Syria. People are saying this is the largest humanitarian disaster since the last world war,” Ms Drew said. 

Ms Drew said it was fantastic to see the public becoming involved in the issue, and believed it was a continuing level of public support that pushed the government to agree to help. 

“There’s word that quite a few towns around the country are willing to take rather large numbers of refugees and help them create new lives,” she said. 

“And a lot more people than the government has agreed to take in.”

According to the federal government, women, children, and families from persecuted minorities sheltering in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey will take priority. 

The government will also spend $44 million supplying 240,000 refugees with cash, food, water and blankets in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.

Senior government officials said the first refugees could arrive by Christmas. 

It’s intended that the 12,000 will arrive within the financial year.</p>

            <h3>Jordan Spieth: Golfer sets prize money record</h3>
            <p>American regains No. 1 ranking with Tour Championship win   (CNN) -  
Record-breaker and history-maker Jordan Spieth has reaped the rewards of becoming golf's new superstar this year -- and now the American is planning to share his riches. 

His spectacular season culminated in landing an $11.5 million jackpot on Sunday, when he regained the world No. 1 ranking by winning the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup finale. 

Spieth's four-stroke victory at the Tour Championship clinched the $10 million prize for winning the four-tournament series, and took his total earnings for 2015 past $22 million. It surpassed the record of $20.9 million set by Tiger Woods in 2007. 
 
"For me it's important to give it back to not only the people that need it, but also to our team who made it possible," the 22-year-old told CNN. 

"This is a bonus that isn't just for me, I promise you that. 

"This is going to a lot of various places because this season was magical and there was a lot of behind the scenes work done by a lot of people, and I want to be able to share that with them." 

With Australian Jason Day failing to finish in the top five on Sunday, Spieth took the PGA Championship winner's place at the top of the rankings. 

The Texan was able to celebrate his incredible weekend of success with his whole family and says it was made all the more special by the presence of his autistic sister Ellie, who missed out on his previous wins. 

"It was really cool, it was great. When she came out I didn't even see her," he said. 

"I wasn't expecting it, she just kind of ran into me and gave me a hug. It was awesome. 

"It was special to have everybody here, it was just like the Masters except that Ellie was added in too. 

"I owe everything to my family. They're my inspiration, they're the ones who put in the sacrifice to allow me to be here so I'm able to now celebrate with them and it's going to be fun." 

Spieth's season started with victories in the opening two majors -- the U.S. Open and the Masters -- and he fell just short of becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the opening three when he missed out on a playoff at the British Open by one shot. 

He then tied for second at the PGA Championship, but missed the cut in the opening two FedEx Cup playoff events before bouncing back when it most mattered at East Lake. 

The Atlanta venue was the home course of golf legend Bobby Jones, the only man to win a calendar grand slam -- in 1930, when two of the majors were amateur championships. 

"It's amazing. It's almost like a major championship," Spieth said of the elite 30-player event. 

"What an unbelievable venue this is, the scene of a lot of Bobby Jones' history. 

"It's cool to come back here and attack this golf course and play it the right way. I didn't make it easy on myself but all in all that last walk up 18 was pretty fun."</p>

            <h3>Diego Maradona Blasts Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini</h3>
            <p>15 de septiembre de 2015,   15:52 Rome, 15 Sep (Prensa Latina) Argentinian super star Diego Maradona has trashed the idea of UEFA President Michel Platini succeeding Sepp Blatter as new FIFA president. 
 Argentinian football legend Maradona suggests Platini is every bit as corrupt as the disgraced, outgoing Blatter.  He has also suggested he'll stand by the side of another candidate come election time. 
During an appearance on Naples television station PiuEnne  Maradona made it clear he considers voting for Platini as merely a vote to continue the same culture of corruption that has recently defined football's governing body: "Blatter did a lot of harm to football and with Platini, it's a farce. They pretend to be separated, one at FIFA and the other at UEFA, while in fact they were always side by side." 

Maradona didn't stop there. He stressed that Platini is no different than Blatter and that the Frenchman is the wrong man to introduce much needed change at the top of the sport: "If we want a transparent FIFA, we cannot vote for Platini who has been close to Blatter, who taught him how to steal." 

The controversial former World Cup winner revealed he will back Prince Ali of Jordan for the presidency.    Maradona even intends to work alongside Ali should the Prince win: "If he should win the election, I will be at his side as vice-president."

            <h3>Breen has funding cut from Athletics Australia</h3>
            <p>Canberra sprinter Melissa Breen has paid the price for a poor world championships by having her funding cut from Athletics Australia. 

Australia's fastest woman in history over 100 metres, the 25-year-old was left off the National Athlete Support Structure membership program on Monday. 

Breen was a late addition to the program last year after she broke Melinda Gainsford-Taylor's 20-year-old national record in the women's 100m with a time of 11.11 seconds. 

But Breen has struggled to carry that form to the world stage and has missed out on the semi-finals four times in a row. 

The final straw was when she finished second-last in her heat at this year's world championships with a disappointing time of 11.61 seconds. 

Athletics Australia high performance director Simon Nathan said it was the selection committee's decision that Breen was unlikely to achieve the program's goals of reaching the top eight at a world championships or Olympic Games. 

"She's done everything she can do and been professional and done all the right things, but the outcomes and the actual results at the championships are such that we can't see her making that top eight in the future," Nathan said. 

"That's why we took her off the program and it lets us support someone else. 

"There isn't anybody who tries harder on the team or is more dedicated to training, but what she is unable to do is get that out at the big championships. 

"It's a competitive group and she's struggling to get out of the first round." 

Breen will still receive partial funding after being included in the Gold Coast GOLD Relay Program designed to support relay squads ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. She also has a scholarship with ACTAS. 

Breen's training partner Lauren Wells, middle-distance runner Zoe Buckman and javelin thrower Kelsey-Lee Roberts have been included in the Podium Potential category. 

It is the second-tier of funding that includes 42 of the 72 athletes who are in the NASS program. 

Breen has admitted she made a mistake in training in Canberra ahead of the world championships instead of competing overseas. 

Nathan said her preparation didn't factor into the funding decision. 

"She tried something different and whether she would do it again, I don't know," Nathan said. "Unless you try, you don't know. 

"It's the championship results and the outcomes in that environment that we are making our assessments on."</p>

Here are this week's candidates for the Lansing State Journal prep athlete of the week. Voting is open until noon Wednesday. (Refresh your browser if the poll doesn't immediately appear.) 

COURTNEY ALLEN, ITHACA CROSS COUNTRY: The Yellowjacket junior runner added to her early season success by finishing first at the Gratiot County Championships last week. Allen had a winning time of 20:02.27. She helped Ithaca take the team title with a score of 25. Allen also finished first at the St. Johns Under the Lights Invitational last month. 

NATHAN MAURER, WILLIAMSTON CROSS COUNTRY: He was the top finisher for Williamston and helped the Hornets win the team title at the Brett Clement Bath Invitational on Saturday. Maurer was seventh overall in 17 minutes and 35 seconds to lead five Williamston runners that finished in the top 17. Maurer has finished in the top 10 in each event he has raced in so far this fall. 

ABBY MEDER, LANSING CATHOLIC GIRLS GOLF: Helped Lansing Catholic take first at a CAAC White jamboree and at the Dick's Sporting Goods Perry Invitational. Meder shared low score honors with a 45 to help the Cougars win the CAAC White jamboree at Brookshire Golf Course. She carded an 82 at Perry to lead Lansing Catholic. 

BLAKE STEWART, ST. JOHNS FOOTBALL: The senior running back was a key part of a rushing attack that helped the Redwings to a road victory over previously unbeaten Mason. Stewart ran for 267 yards and three touchdowns in the 49-28 win. That included an 80-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put St. Johns ahead by two scores.

            <h3>Nothing is Given: Hayden Hamby</h3>
            <p>"Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence." Vince Lombardi #BoilerUp http://t.co/MfjF8jAP8x

— Purdue Women's Bball (@PurdueWBB) 2015-16 Roster / 2015-16 Schedule 

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - Purdue women’s basketball senior Hayden Hamby heads into her final season with the Old Gold and Black, and was voted a team captain for the 2015-16 campaign. Hamby has appeared in 82 games over the last three seasons, including seven starts, and is a two-time Academic All-Big Ten honoree. 

In addition to her pair of academic all-conference honors, Hamby was named a Big Ten Distinguished Scholar in 2015, awarded to student-athletes with a grade-point average of 3.7 or higher. Hamby averaged 3.2 points and 1.6 rebounds in 15.7 minutes per game last season, but boosted those averages in the Boilermakers’ three-game European tour this summer. She had a breakout performance against German professional squad TK Hannover, posting nine points and eight rebounds, and was Purdue’s second-leading rebounder on the trip. 

Practice begins Oct. 7 for the Boilermakers with the exhibition game set for Nov. 8 against Marian University.</p>

            <h3>Hever Castle Triathlon: 2015 preview</h3>
            <p>Ultimate triathlon  extravaganza set for Hever Castle Triathlon  
It is the final flagship race of the Castle  Triathlon Series and a
jam-packed, televised weekend with competitors of all  ages and abilities
signed up to take part in one of the biggest multisport  events in the UK.
Triathlon returns for the seventh annual Hever Castle
Triathlon weekend over the 26th and 27th September, ready  to write
another historic chapter at the former home of King Henry VIII. 
 
Fittingly for its seventh edition, the number  seven features prominently
throughout the event – starting with a record breaking  number of
entries currently standing at 7,000. The youngest competitor lining  up in
the world's biggest kids race is seven, whilst the oldest competitor is 77. 
 

 
The stunning venue, located in the heart of Kent,  welcomes competitors
from across the UK and internationally in a series of  distances and
challenges (including the biggest children's triathlon in the  world). Its
position at the end of the busy triathlon calendar and the final  stop on
the Castle Triathlon Series means that there is a party-like festival
atmosphere as triathletes sign off their season with PB's, new distances
achieved or sporting success shared with their friends of families. The
atmosphere is boosted by 500 camping through the weekend and lots of
entertainment including bands, climbing walls, archery, trade stands, fun
fair  and pleasure rides. 
 
The event attracts some of the best triathletes in  Britain who are set
to race hard and fast for their share of the trophies and  prize money. Up
for grabs this year is a prize fund of £8,000 that stands at
£2,000  for the Standard Distance race, whilst those triumphing in the
toughest  challenge of the day, the half-iron Gauntlet race, will also take
home their  share of £2,000. Further prizes are given for Series
winners. 
 Favourites  for The Gauntlet 2015 titles  
The Gauntlet at Hever Castle is the biggest test in  the Castle Triathlon
Series. The half-iron distance triathlon takes competitors  into the rolling
hills of the Kent Weald and through an ‘area of outstanding  beauty'.
Triathletes who took on the 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run last  year
unequivocally reviewed it as one of the ‘must-do' events in the UK and
attracted  to the challenge, the field has grown once again this year from
200 in 2013 to  now over 850 – making it one of the most popular in
the country. 
 
Spearheading the men's field will be the intriguing  re-match between
Darren Jenkins (Bastion 2015 champion) and Karl Alexander  (Hever Castle
Gauntlet 2013 champion). These two had an awesome battle at Hever  Castle
earlier this year over the iron-distance Bastion Triathlon in July, with
Jenkins emerging on top with his fearsome run proving the decisive factor.
Now set  to battle it out again over the middle distance, will Jenkins once
again have  the upper hand, or will the shorter distance suit Alexander who
will have less  run course to cover before the finish line comes? These
questions and more will  all be answered over the race. 
 
Jenkins and Alexander won't have it all their own  way as there is talent
throughout the field, not least in the form of XTERRA  professional Matt
Dewis, Irish Middle Distance champion Kevin Thornton and  talented racer
Will Cowan – who can all challenge for the podium and have the  class
to win. 
 
British and Scottish Middle Distance Champion Nikki  Bartlett is in the
field and is the clear favourite for the women's title at  Hever Castle
Gauntlet Triathlon. 
 
Also in the field is Pete Dyson, Andy Dyson, Max  Hazell, Ben Matthews,
Colin Norris, Ben Pritchard and Neil Tandy. The women's  race will feature
Bex Milnes and Kim Morrison. 
 Olympic  distance speedsters  
Whilst the Gauntlet represents a test of speed over  distance at Hever
Castle Triathlon, the speed kings and queens will take on the  Olympic
distance triathlon, which comprises of the shorter (but no less  testing),
distances of 1.5km swim, 40km bike and 10km run. Competing for these  titles
will be elite athletes including Liam Lloyd, Phil Edgley, James Fearn,
Calum Johnson, William Kirk and Scott Thompson. 
 
The women's race looks particularly exciting, with Catherine  Jameson
headlining the field. Jameson is a fearsome competitor on the Castle
Triathlon Series circuit and has picked up wins at Chateau du Chantilly,
Castle  Howard and Cholmondeley already this year. Jameson is such a fan of
the Hever  Castle Triathlon that she has published her top ten reasons to do
the race HERE . 
 
Hever Castle would complete the set. However, a  challenge will come from
another former Hever Castle Champion, Vicky Johnston  and also from the
reigning European Aquathlon Champion Hannah Kitchen. 
 Hever Castle  – the ‘must-do British
race'  
In just six years the Hever Castle Triathlon has  swiftly established
itself as an essential destination for British and  international
triathletes, garnering plaudits and mainstream media attention  for its
picture postcard venue, elite action, age-group choice and festival
atmosphere.  There are no fewer than 14  race choices on offer making it one
of the biggest events in the UK. 
 
To cement the race's title as the world's largest  children's triathlon,
over 1,600 junior athletes are expected to take part. 
 
The races will begin with an amended and unique  open-water swim in the
spectacular 38 acre Hever Castle Lake and River Eden.  This creates an
incredible spectacle that is  rewarding for both the athletes and the
spectators who can see one of the most  exciting parts of the race up-close.
Competitors in The Gauntlet will take on a  single 1.9km lap whilst those
racing in the Olympic distance will take on (for  the first time), a single
1.5km lap. 
 

 
Those taking part will then transition onto the  undulating cycle that
takes athletes around a 20km circuit through the High  Weald of Kent, an
Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with one lap for the  Sprint and two
laps for the Olympic-distance racers. Those on The Gauntlet will  be on a
specially designed two-lap course. The largely off-road run  circumnavigates
the estate and award-winning castle grounds before making the  dash to the
tree-lined finishing chute beside the lake. 
  Fun for  spectators too  
This year there is even more planned for friends,  family and all the
supporters at the Hever Castle Triathlon Triathlon, with a  variety of live
music, family games and of course a brilliant atmosphere for  all.  Relax in
the grounds of one of the  most famous castles in England and enjoy the
action unfold!
