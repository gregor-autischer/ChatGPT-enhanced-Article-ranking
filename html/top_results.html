            <h3>Mudgee branch of Amnesty International welcomes decision on Syrian refugees</h3>
            <p>The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. Ms Drew said Amnesty was pleased the Australian government has decided to take in some of the millions of Syrian’s unable to return home, especially considering how desperate the situation is getting. 

“It’s a start really,” Ms Drew said.

“The number of Syrian people who are no longer able to return to their own country is in its millions, and all of these people are desperate to make a new home for themselves. 

“We’ve agreed to take 12,000 but the government may need to think about agreeing to take more.”

Ms Drew said while some people had made suggestions that the number was too high, Germany had agreed to house 800,000 refugees that made their way to Europe.

“Twelve thousand people sounds wonderful in comparison to the number Australia agreed to take a year ago, but compared to the total number of people who need help – maybe the government will need to look at the figures again,” Ms Drew said.

Ms Drew said there are around four million Syrian refugees registered with humanitarian groups. 

A large percentage of these people are immigrated to neighbouring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, putting strain on the local economies and resources. 

“There are 7.6 million people who are internally displaced in Syria. People are saying this is the largest humanitarian disaster since the last world war,” Ms Drew said. 

Ms Drew said it was fantastic to see the public becoming involved in the issue, and believed it was a continuing level of public support that pushed the government to agree to help. 

“There’s word that quite a few towns around the country are willing to take rather large numbers of refugees and help them create new lives,” she said. 

“And a lot more people than the government has agreed to take in.”

According to the federal government, women, children, and families from persecuted minorities sheltering in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey will take priority. 

The government will also spend $44 million supplying 240,000 refugees with cash, food, water and blankets in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.

Senior government officials said the first refugees could arrive by Christmas. 

It’s intended that the 12,000 will arrive within the financial year.</p>

            <h3>Jordan Spieth: Golfer sets prize money record</h3>
            <p>American regains No. 1 ranking with Tour Championship win   (CNN) -  
Record-breaker and history-maker Jordan Spieth has reaped the rewards of becoming golf's new superstar this year -- and now the American is planning to share his riches. 

His spectacular season culminated in landing an $11.5 million jackpot on Sunday, when he regained the world No. 1 ranking by winning the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup finale. 

Spieth's four-stroke victory at the Tour Championship clinched the $10 million prize for winning the four-tournament series, and took his total earnings for 2015 past $22 million. It surpassed the record of $20.9 million set by Tiger Woods in 2007. 
 
"For me it's important to give it back to not only the people that need it, but also to our team who made it possible," the 22-year-old told CNN. 

"This is a bonus that isn't just for me, I promise you that. 

"This is going to a lot of various places because this season was magical and there was a lot of behind the scenes work done by a lot of people, and I want to be able to share that with them." 

With Australian Jason Day failing to finish in the top five on Sunday, Spieth took the PGA Championship winner's place at the top of the rankings. 

The Texan was able to celebrate his incredible weekend of success with his whole family and says it was made all the more special by the presence of his autistic sister Ellie, who missed out on his previous wins. 

"It was really cool, it was great. When she came out I didn't even see her," he said. 

"I wasn't expecting it, she just kind of ran into me and gave me a hug. It was awesome. 

"It was special to have everybody here, it was just like the Masters except that Ellie was added in too. 

"I owe everything to my family. They're my inspiration, they're the ones who put in the sacrifice to allow me to be here so I'm able to now celebrate with them and it's going to be fun." 

Spieth's season started with victories in the opening two majors -- the U.S. Open and the Masters -- and he fell just short of becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the opening three when he missed out on a playoff at the British Open by one shot. 

He then tied for second at the PGA Championship, but missed the cut in the opening two FedEx Cup playoff events before bouncing back when it most mattered at East Lake. 

The Atlanta venue was the home course of golf legend Bobby Jones, the only man to win a calendar grand slam -- in 1930, when two of the majors were amateur championships. 

"It's amazing. It's almost like a major championship," Spieth said of the elite 30-player event. 

"What an unbelievable venue this is, the scene of a lot of Bobby Jones' history. 

"It's cool to come back here and attack this golf course and play it the right way. I didn't make it easy on myself but all in all that last walk up 18 was pretty fun."</p>

            <h3>Diego Maradona Blasts Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini</h3>
            <p>15 de septiembre de 2015,   15:52 Rome, 15 Sep (Prensa Latina) Argentinian super star Diego Maradona has trashed the idea of UEFA President Michel Platini succeeding Sepp Blatter as new FIFA president. 
 Argentinian football legend Maradona suggests Platini is every bit as corrupt as the disgraced, outgoing Blatter.  He has also suggested he'll stand by the side of another candidate come election time. 
During an appearance on Naples television station PiuEnne  Maradona made it clear he considers voting for Platini as merely a vote to continue the same culture of corruption that has recently defined football's governing body: "Blatter did a lot of harm to football and with Platini, it's a farce. They pretend to be separated, one at FIFA and the other at UEFA, while in fact they were always side by side." 

Maradona didn't stop there. He stressed that Platini is no different than Blatter and that the Frenchman is the wrong man to introduce much needed change at the top of the sport: "If we want a transparent FIFA, we cannot vote for Platini who has been close to Blatter, who taught him how to steal." 

The controversial former World Cup winner revealed he will back Prince Ali of Jordan for the presidency.    Maradona even intends to work alongside Ali should the Prince win: "If he should win the election, I will be at his side as vice-president."

            <h3>Cobalt: Is Peter Moody on the brink of unravelling?</h3>
            <p>For those outside the inner sanctum of the racing industry who are perplexed at the mileage the Peter Moody saga has gained this week or, for that matter, the past few months, the answer is simple: an unrelenting media cheer squad. 

Even those removed from the sport can see by his poor-taste rants that Moody is slowly unravelling. Whichever way he manoeuvres the question remains: how did Lidari arrive at Flemington with double the threshold levels of cobalt in its system? 

But the media cheer squad continue to skirt around the clear realities of the case. 

For the third time this week, Moody threatened to resign from racing. He's threatened to move to Darwin, talked about a pub in Queensland and, for all we know, by Saturday night he may be looking at a convenience store in Papua New Guinea. 

He has 110 of some of the most expensive racehorses in Australia housed at his Caulfield base. His winning strike-rate has not altered, nor has his client base deserted him since Lidari's swab earlier this year. 

But his trusting media contingency was shown at their very best this week, as they gave Moody more oxygen to explain why the world is against him. 

You see, it's a one-way deal. Moody is a man not to fall out with, so the premiership-winning trainer has polarised the media. 

The height of the pro-Moody campaign was achieved by a News Limited reporter — who had been barred off and on from the Moody stable over the past decade — who even checked out how the trainer was faring the night of his now-infamous race-day treatment at Pakenham. 

The reporter went on to say Moody had arrived home to find the family gone out for the night and he had to manage on scraps and a few beers and their faithful dog for company. 

However, worse was to come. On Memsie Stakes day at Caulfield, at the start of the meeting, former AFL clerk and racing tipster Shane Anderson mournfully announced after Moody had won the opening race that the trainer would not speak to the media for the remainder of the day as he was under pressure over the cobalt matter. 

This message went out to the newly-launched Channel 78 viewers plus  racing.com . 

Anderson, the day before Memsie Stakes day, had given Moody 20 minutes of air time to tell his sad-and-sorry story. The only challenging question from Anderson was: "Do you mind if we go for a commercial break?" 

During this interview Moody challenged the industry to "pull the splinters out of your arse and join me or not". 

While Anderson conveyed the news the cobalt issue had prevented Moody speaking to the media, 20 metres from where Anderson was working, stewards were grilling Moody over the outrageous statements made on Anderson's show and told the trainer of Black Caviar that such outbursts would not be tolerated. They went on to remind Moody of his obligations to the licence that he holds. 

This was not broadcast on Channel 78 nor reported on  racing.com . It took Fairfax Media's Andrew Garvey to question whether Moody's media ban was connected with stewards. 

He was told Moody was spoken to about his remarks made on Anderson's show. 

When Fairfax Media tried to contact Channel 78 chief executive Scott Perrin to see if any action had been taken against Anderson, the CEO did not answer our calls. 

Anderson last Wednesday gave Moody another 20 minutes of air time to bag officials and continue to cry foul. 

The level of questioning by Anderson was shameful. "We go back a long way, Pete" is not good enough for balanced news. 

It's interesting to note that two weeks last Wednesday Ballarat trainer Kylie Vella was charged under the same race-day-treatment rule for using the same poultice as Moody's filly. 

Vella was not given a paragraph in racing publications nor air play on Anderson's show. 

And it's strange how integrity officers Australia-wide were sacked over the live-baiting scandal that rocked greyhound racing — with governments and media claiming those in charge had fallen asleep at the wheel — but once three leading trainers are netted, the rule book must be changed. 

A mindless collection of quotes from Moody's friends in the Caulfield trainers' hut that came out in support of him is nowhere near reflective of the feeling of trainers. 

Fairfax Media has received countless emails from around the state applauding the integrity department of Racing Victoria, as they are sick of being beaten by cheats. 

And it would be timely to allow Moody, Mark Kavanagh, Danny O'Brien, and Lee and Shannon Hope to have their cases heard without cheer squads and self-styled experts who have a year-nine biology background. 

It's worth noting that Lee and Shannon Hope have shown class and dignity after they were charged last year. 

The didn't ask for any media free kicks or inside runs. They are sitting and waiting, aware that talking and yelling won't help their cause. It's timely advice for a few others waiting for their day in court to arrive.

Davis Follow @allisonpdavis No photos over six hours old allowed. 37 Shares Share 29 Tweet 8 Share 0 Pin It 0 Share Email Print Share Photo: Uwe Umstaetter/Westend61/Corbis The best photo of me was taken about a few years ago: I will never again look so young, so free, or so skinny as I was in that shot. Do I still use that fairly blatant misrepresentation of my current self on my OKCupid profile? You bet I do.  Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us.   Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn’t matter who you are now — bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo — 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?
At first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering. Maybe six hours is too long a time period.

            <h3>Breen has funding cut from Athletics Australia</h3>
            <p>Canberra sprinter Melissa Breen has paid the price for a poor world championships by having her funding cut from Athletics Australia. 

Australia's fastest woman in history over 100 metres, the 25-year-old was left off the National Athlete Support Structure membership program on Monday. 

Breen was a late addition to the program last year after she broke Melinda Gainsford-Taylor's 20-year-old national record in the women's 100m with a time of 11.11 seconds. 

But Breen has struggled to carry that form to the world stage and has missed out on the semi-finals four times in a row. 

The final straw was when she finished second-last in her heat at this year's world championships with a disappointing time of 11.61 seconds. 

Athletics Australia high performance director Simon Nathan said it was the selection committee's decision that Breen was unlikely to achieve the program's goals of reaching the top eight at a world championships or Olympic Games. 

"She's done everything she can do and been professional and done all the right things, but the outcomes and the actual results at the championships are such that we can't see her making that top eight in the future," Nathan said. 

"That's why we took her off the program and it lets us support someone else. 

"There isn't anybody who tries harder on the team or is more dedicated to training, but what she is unable to do is get that out at the big championships. 

"It's a competitive group and she's struggling to get out of the first round." 

Breen will still receive partial funding after being included in the Gold Coast GOLD Relay Program designed to support relay squads ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. She also has a scholarship with ACTAS. 

Breen's training partner Lauren Wells, middle-distance runner Zoe Buckman and javelin thrower Kelsey-Lee Roberts have been included in the Podium Potential category. 

It is the second-tier of funding that includes 42 of the 72 athletes who are in the NASS program. 

Breen has admitted she made a mistake in training in Canberra ahead of the world championships instead of competing overseas. 

Nathan said her preparation didn't factor into the funding decision. 

"She tried something different and whether she would do it again, I don't know," Nathan said. "Unless you try, you don't know. 

"It's the championship results and the outcomes in that environment that we are making our assessments on."</p>

COURTNEY ALLEN, ITHACA CROSS COUNTRY: The Yellowjacket junior runner added to her early season success by finishing first at the Gratiot County Championships last week.

NATHAN MAURER, WILLIAMSTON CROSS COUNTRY: He was the top finisher for Williamston and helped the Hornets win the team title at the Brett Clement Bath Invitational on Saturday. Maurer was seventh overall in 17 minutes and 35 seconds to lead five Williamston runners that finished in the top 17. Maurer has finished in the top 10 in each event he has raced in so far this fall. 

ABBY MEDER, LANSING CATHOLIC GIRLS GOLF: Helped Lansing Catholic take first at a CAAC White jamboree and at the Dick's Sporting Goods Perry Invitational. Meder shared low score honors with a 45 to help the Cougars win the CAAC White jamboree at Brookshire Golf Course. She carded an 82 at Perry to lead Lansing Catholic. 

BLAKE STEWART, ST. JOHNS FOOTBALL: The senior running back was a key part of a rushing attack that helped the Redwings to a road victory over previously unbeaten Mason. Stewart ran for 267 yards and three touchdowns in the 49-28 win. That included an 80-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put St. Johns ahead by two scores.
